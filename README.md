# d3-navigation

d3-navigation is a widget (based on d3 [example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063550)) I have wrote for one project, here I just try to rewrite it step by step for reuse.

- create turntable
- create leaves with nba teams information
- create linkage between different level
- interaction: click on division would update teams outside
- add pointer as instruction and make round item rotate
- reconstruct and module the javascript part
- use sea.js for module mangement
